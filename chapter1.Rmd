**1.1**  I am rather exited to start this course, **although** I am a bit worried that the workload will be too much for me. I hope though, that **if** I manage with the the workload, I will have the skills to start independently developing as a user of R and a contributor to open data science. It is especially the **latter** point that brought me to this course, although I did not actively look for it. I just happened to run into it on the course page of the *University of Helsinki*.  

**1.2**  In what has been a rather unpleasant experience, GitHub did not immediately work for me. Nothing seemed to upload to my diary.  Now, I think, I have managed to overcome my issues and get things to work most of the time. Learning by doing, I suppose!

**To summarize:**  
- I want to learn open data science.  
- I am worried the workload will be too much.  
- I look forward to the course.
